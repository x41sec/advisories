==================================================

Confirmed Patched Versions: v2.102.9508 
Vendor: Indamed

Summary and Impact
------------------
Indamed Medical Office contains an XSS issue and stores user passwords
as unsalted MD5 hashes. This allows to attack users and, in case an attacker
gets access to the filesystem, retrieve plain text passwords.


Product Description
-------------------
Indamed Medical Office allows you to manage a medical office and patients.

Passwords stored as MD5 Hash
============================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Database Access
CVE: N/A
CWE: 916
CVSS Score: 6.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N


Analysis
--------
Indamed Medical Office stores the secret passwords of the users as an MD5 hash in
'C:\INDAMED\dat\MEDOFF.GDB'. MD5 can be brute-forced efficiently and should not be used
for such purposes. Additionally, since no salt is used, rainbow
tables can speed up the attack. These can be extracted easily and due to the
nature of the database even reveal older hashes.


Proof of Concept
----------------
strings MEDOFF.GDB | grep -e "^[0-9a-f]{32}$" | sort | uniq

XSS in Webinterface
===================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Network
CVE: N/A
CWE: 79
CVSS Score: 5.4
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/CR:L/IR:L 


Analysis
--------
The HTTP server running on localhost:2019, which is reachable via the 
nginx server remotely, contains an XSS security flaw, which can be triggered
easily via a malicious URL. This might allow an attacker to steal session
data or modify the website.
The webserver is only used for the REST-API which might render this
attack vector useless.


Proof of Concept
----------------
/mo/test<script>alert(1)</script>


Workarounds
-----------
A quick workaround might be to add a WAF into the nginx configuration.
