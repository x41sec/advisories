Summary and Impact
==================
The GeDoWin Geburt software backend stores clear text credentials in its MSSQL
database if it was upgraded from a legacy system.
The clear text credentials are the ones which were used before the
upgrade from the legacy system and may have been replaced by the users.
If a user tries to login, GeDoWin Geburt queries
the remote database and gets the old credentials in XML format. Due to internal
caching of valid database credentials this also worked with using wrong
credentials to login in our test.
The credentials from the XML file are stored in plain text and are not secured
in any way.
An attacker could obtain all old unprotected credentials of users of the
GeDoWin Geburt software this way. This could give an attacker credentials
which may still be valid and could be used by the users for other services
as well.

Product Description
===================
GeDoWin Geburt is software for birth documentation in labor and delivery units.
Multiple clients share one remote database.

Analysis
========
Gedowin Geburt stores the old passwords without protection in the TGNGPersonal table.
This could violate the General Data Protection Regulation and exposes the
user's old credentials to risk.
Due to internal caching, GeDoWin Geburt clients are able to login to the Gedowin Geburt
database using the client with invalid credentials, if a valid user has
been logged in with valid credentials before.
Therefore even users with invalid credentials could be able to receive the XML file with
clear-text credentials from the old users and login using these
credentials from old accounts which have not been changed and also use all
services which share the same username and password combination.

Workarounds
===========
The clear-text passwords will be removed when updating to GeDoWin Geburt 2020.2
or later.
The vendor states that the users should have been requested to change their
passwords after the upgrade from the legacy system.
All users should be notified to use unique credentials
for GeDoWin Geburt and to change their credentials if they still use
the passwords which they used for the legacy system.
