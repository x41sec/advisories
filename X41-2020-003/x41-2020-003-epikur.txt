X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2020-003

Multiple Vulnerabilities in Epikur
==================================
Highest Severity Rating: Critical
Confirmed Affected Versions: 20.1.0.1
Confirmed Patched Versions: 20.1.1
Vendor: Epikur Software & IT Services GmbH
Vendor URL: https://www.epikur.de/

Summary and Impact
------------------
Several flaws regarding authentication have been identified in
Epikur, which allow attackers to access sensitive information.
Among the issues identified is a backdoor password, weak password hashes
and hardcoded credentials.


Product Description
-------------------
Epikur allows you to manage a medical office and patients.

Backdoor Password
=================
Severity Rating: Critical
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2020-10539
CWE: 798
CVSS Score: 10.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H


Analysis
--------
The Epikur server contains the checkPasswort() function that, upon user
login, checks the submitted password against the user password's MD5 hash
stored in the database. It is also compared to a second MD5 hash, which is the
same for every user. If the submitted password matches either one, access is
granted.

----------------%<-------------------
public boolean checkPasswort(String otherPassword) {
  return (otherPassword.equals(this.passwd) || otherPassword.equals("mhEVfZUMEwwvr8b9SEpLhA=="));
}
----------------%<-------------------

Brute-forcing the second hash reveals that the password 3p1kursupport will
allow you to login as any user.

Passwords stored as MD5 Hash
============================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Database Access
CVE: CVE-2020-10538
CWE: 916
CVSS Score: 6.0
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N


Analysis
--------
Epikur stores the secret passwords of the users as an MD5 hash in the
database. MD5 can be brute-forced efficiently and should not be used 
for such purposes. Additionally, since no salt is used, rainbow
tables can speed up the attack.

Glassfish Administrator Password Not Set
========================================
Severity Rating: Medium
Vector: Local Network Interface
CVE: CVE-2020-10537
CWE: 258
CVSS Score: 6.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L


Analysis
--------
A Glassfish 4.1 server with default configuration is running on TCP port 4848.
No password is required to access it with the administrator account.
