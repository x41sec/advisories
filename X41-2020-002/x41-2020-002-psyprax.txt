attacker gain access or elevate privileges.


Product Description
-------------------
Psyprax allows you to manage a medical office and patients.

Screensaver Password not protected
==================================
Severity Rating: High
Vector: Local User
CVE: CVE-2020-10553
CWE: 522
CVSS Score: 8.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H


Analysis
--------
The file C:\ProgramData\Psyprax32\PPScreen.ini contains a hash for 
the lockscreen of the application. If that entry is removed, the lockscreen
is no longer displayed and the app is no longer locked. All local
users are able to modify that file.


Workarounds
-----------
Use proper Windows screen locking.

Firebird Database accessible with default password
==================================================
Severity Rating: Critical
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2020-10552
CWE: 862
CVSS Score: 9.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H


Analysis
--------
The Firebird database is accessible with the default user 'sysdba' and
password 'masterke' after installation. This allows any user to access it 
and read and modify the contents, including passwords. Local database
files can be accessed directly as well.


Workarounds
-----------
Properly firewall the database and set a password.

Passwords not securely stored
=============================
Severity Rating: High
Vector: Local
CVE: CVE-2020-10554
CWE: 257
CVSS Score: 8.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H


Analysis
--------
Passwords used to encrypt the data are stored in the database in an obfuscated 
format, which can be easily reverted. For example the password 'AAAAAAAA' is 
stored in the database as 'MMMMMMMM'.
These can be retrieved via the database:
SQL> select * from KCFPCONFIGPARAM where KCFP_PARAM = 'CryptPassword';


Workarounds
-----------
A proper password storage algorithm that includes a salt and is strong enough to prevent
brute force attacks, such as argon2, scrypt or bcrypt, should be implemented.
